But it may turn out that the best new use may be closer to the station’s original purpose — a transportation hub.
Matthew Moroun, son of depot owner Manuel (Matty) Moroun and the new public face of the Moroun business empire, told WWJ radio recently that it was possible the family might consider moving some of its operations into the train station.
The Morouns’ Warren-based CenTra (a shortening of Central Transport) is a North American trucking network employing thousands of employees.
Moving even a portion of that into the old train station would recreate a transportation hub there even if it doesn’t replace the train service that once made the depot famous as a city landmark.
Reusing the tower portion of the depot as either housing or office space could make sense given current economics, he said.
