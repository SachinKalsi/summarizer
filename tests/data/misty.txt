Misty Copeland, pioneering black ballerina, to dance in Detroit
Misty C is coming to dance in the D.

Misty Copeland, who made history in June when she became the first African-American woman to be appointed a principal dancer at the 75-year-old American Ballet Theatre, will be part of the cast when the New York-based company presents “The Sleeping Beauty” at the Detroit Opera House in spring 2016.

Copeland, 32, will offer a sneak peak of the spring production when she and Gabe Stone Shayer of ABT perform a pas de deux from “The Sleeping Beauty” at Michigan Opera Theatre’s annual Opera Ball Gala fund-raiser on Oct. 3.

Copland previously appeared on the stage of the Detroit Opera House in 2009, when she danced a secondary role in two performances of ABT's production of "Romeo and Juliet."

Even before her recent promotion at ABT, Copeland had become a bona fide star, achieving a visibility and celebrity within popular culture unusual in the world of ballet. She also has become a beacon for diversity in the nearly all-white world of classical dance, overcoming a tough childhood and late start in dance to reach the top of her profession at one of the world’s leading ballet companies.

Copeland’s notoriety has gone off the charts since July, as her achievement at ABT earned a tsunami of press coverage. She’ll arrive in Detroit as the most famous dancer on the planet.

MOT president Wayne Brown said that the company was thrilled that Copeland was appearing at the gala and that her appearance in “Sleeping Beauty” was consistent with MOT’s long history of showcasing young opera singers with diverse backgrounds.

“We look forward to building on that success with classical ballet,” Brown said.

MOT officials said that ABT has confirmed that, barring injury or other unforeseen circumstances, Copeland will be part of the company that performs “The Sleeping Beauty” in Detroit. However, decisions about what role Copland will dance and the number of performances in which she will appear haven’t been made.

MOT, which is co-presenting ABT’s local appearance with the University Musical Society in Ann Arbor, expects to be able to announce casting details in December. There will be four Detroit performances of “The Sleeping Beauty,” with music by Tchaikovsky, on March 31-April 3.

Born in Missouri but raised in Los Angeles by a single mother, Copeland started studying ballet at age 13 at a local Boys and Girl’s Club. By 15 she was already being recognized as gifted, and she began studying at ABT’s summer programs in 1999. She formally joined the company in 2001 and became a soloist in 2007.

Copeland is only the second black dancer and first ballerina at ABT to be named a principal, after Desmond Richardson in 1997. (Principal is the highest rank in the ballet world for a dancer.)

Among Copeland’s accomplishments outside the ABT arena include writing a best-selling memoir, “Life in Motion” (which has been optioned for a movie), appearing in a music video by Prince, being named one of Time Magazine’s most influential people for 2015 and starring in an online ad for Under Armour sportswear.

At a press conference in June in New York, Copeland called becoming a principal dancer at ABT a lifelong dream, but also acknowledged doubts about ever being able to achieve it.

“So many young dancers of color stop dancing at an early age because they just don't think there will be a career path for them,” Copeland said. “I hope that will change.”
