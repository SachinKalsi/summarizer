Copland previously appeared on the stage of the Detroit Opera House in 2009, when she danced a secondary role in two performances of ABT's production of "Romeo and Juliet."
Copeland’s notoriety has gone off the charts since July, as her achievement at ABT earned a tsunami of press coverage.
However, decisions about what role Copland will dance and the number of performances in which she will appear haven’t been made.
There will be four Detroit performances of “The Sleeping Beauty,” with music by Tchaikovsky, on March 31-April 3.
Copeland is only the second black dancer and first ballerina at ABT to be named a principal, after Desmond Richardson in 1997.
